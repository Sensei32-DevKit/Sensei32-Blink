## 🚀 Features

In Sensei32, every pin of ESP32 has been brought to the board perimeter through castellated holes, so that the user can decide to:

- Solder the provided **18650 battery holder** and pin-headers, using Sensei32 as a standard ESP32 DevKit, ready for your battery-operated DIY projects.
- Solder Sensei32 to a custom carrier PCB, using Sensei32 as a feature-packed ESP32 module, with **any Li-Ion or Li-Poly external battery** (up to 6000mAh).

Sensei32 has **world-class ULP performance**, consuming about **21uA in deep-sleep** while providing a **stable 3.3V** over the whole voltage range of a single cell Li-Ion.

- Texas Instruments **TPS63900**, buck-boost dc-dc converted
- Texas Instruments **HDC1080**, environment sensor (T, RH)
- BOSCH **BME688**, AI-Powered air-quality sensor (T, RH, P, eCO2, bVOC, IAQ)
- **USB Voltage Sensing**, routed to IO36
- **Battery Voltage Sensing**, routed to IO35
- **Battery Charging/Floating Sensing**, routed to IO39
- **Activity LED**, routed to IO2
- **USB Power Supply LED** and **Battery InCharge LED**, managed by BQ24092

## 🤖 Tech

Sensei32 is designed around the **ESP32 WROOM**, a battery charger (**BQ24092**) and ultra-low power regulator (**TPS63900**) ICs. The choice of these devices provide a particularly stable 3.3V over the whole voltage range of a single cell Li-Ion, enabling the operation until the battery reaches the discharge threshold. The integrated sensors for Temperature, Humidity, Pressure and Air Quality (**BME688**, AI Powered) and precision temperature and humidity (**HDC1080**) provide an exceptional environmental sensing ability.

The **USB Micro AB** connector is used for both charging and programming, as data lines are routed to an original **FT231XQ-R** USB-serial chip, which is supplied with power only by the 5V USB-VBus line, thus avoiding unnecessary battery usage when not programming or charging. This unique feature enables a 5V power source to keep the battery replenished whilst consuming ultra-low power.  

Sensei32 shares the same form-factor (every mechanical feature including button placement) and pinout of [WEMOS ESP32 Board with 18650 Battery Holder][WEMOS], representing a drag & drop replacement for every project that is already using this very common board, but with a far better ULP performance, components quality and integrated sensors. Sensei32 also has two extra pins on the right-side connector to break out VBAT (Battery line) and GND, enabling the use of any external Li-Ion or Li-Poly battery (up to 6000mAh). The Sensei32 also has an in-built battery monitoring facilities, together with an NTC resistor that is used to monitor battery and battery charger temperatures. The **NTC resistor is not reachable from the ESP32**, as it is dedicated to the BQ24092 battery charger.

While the power architecture of Sensei32 can operate with VBAT voltages (Battery line) exceeding the [2.6V, 4.2V] operational range, it's recommended to stay between the limits specified by the Li-Ion or Li-Poly battery manufaturer and always use Li-Ion or Li-Poly batteries from a trusty manufacturer, like a Samsung INR18650-30Q and/or a INR18650-35E cell.

> To avoid any operating interference with the ESP32 Internal Flash, Sensei32 **do not** break out ESP32 Internal Flash QSPI Pins.
> To ensure this does not happen, **In place of** IO6 (FLASH_SCK), IO7 (FLASH_D0), IO8 (FLASH_D1), IO9 (FLASH_D2), IO10 (FLASH_D3), IO11 (FLASH_CMD) **Sensei32 has GND Pins**.

## 🚦 Compiling the sketch with Arduino

### 1. Install the latest Arduino IDE and ESP32 BSP

As of this publication, the latest Arduino IDE 1.8.13 can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.arduino.cc/download_handler.php). In order to compile the Sensei32 Starter Package, the ESP32 Arduino Board Support Package should be already installed from "Tools > Board Manager". There are plenty of guides online that show how to install and use an ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE, as a reference: [How to install ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE][arduesp]. 

Once installed the ESP32 Arduino Board Support Package, Sensei32 Arduino board configuration should match the following:

| Configuration | Setting |
| ------ | ------ |
| Board | ESP32 Wrover Module |
| Upload Speed | 921600 |
| Flash Frequency | 80MHz |
| Flash Mode | QIO |
| Partition Scheme | Default 4MB with spiffs |

### 2. You are ready to go!

Just upload the firmware to your Sensei32 board and enjoy!
